# javascript-basics

These are the notes I have been taking whilst doing the JavaScript course from jonas.io.

The topics and their basic functionality covered are:

* Variables and data types
* Variable mutation and type coercion
* Basic operators
* Operator precedence
* If / else statements
* Boolean logic
* Functions
* Function statements and expressions
* Arrays
* Objects and properties
* Objects and methods

In between topics, you will notice challenges which are used by the instructor to test my knowledge on topics we had covered.
